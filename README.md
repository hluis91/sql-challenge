Data Modeling: The ERD SQL HW.png shows the ERD table for the six tables provided.  I created an ERD diagram from the following link: https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
Data Engineering: The createtableshw.sql has the code to create the tables along with primary, foreign and composite keys. The code was exported from the ERD diagram link.
Data Analysis: The sqlhwqueries.sql file answers the eight queries for the Data Analysis portion of the homework.
